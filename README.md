# Predictive Maintenance System: An Advanced Prolog-Based Industrial Equipment Monitoring Solution 🏭🛠️

Welcome to the Predictive Maintenance System repository! This project aims to develop a sophisticated Prolog-based system for predictive maintenance of industrial equipment, incorporating advanced sensor analytics and rule-based logic. Join us on this journey to revolutionize industrial maintenance practices and optimize equipment uptime! 🚀

## Description ℹ️

Predictive maintenance is a critical aspect of modern industrial operations, leveraging data-driven approaches to anticipate equipment failures and schedule proactive maintenance tasks. Traditional reactive maintenance strategies often lead to costly downtime and decreased productivity. In contrast, predictive maintenance systems empower organizations to forecast equipment issues before they occur, reducing downtime, minimizing maintenance costs, and maximizing operational efficiency.

The Predictive Maintenance System presented here harnesses the power of Prolog, a versatile logic programming language, to analyze sensor data from various industrial equipment types and predict maintenance needs based on predefined rules and thresholds. By integrating sensor readings, rule-based logic, and predictive analytics, this system provides actionable insights into equipment health and enables proactive maintenance planning.

## Installation 🚀

Setting up the Predictive Maintenance System on your local machine is straightforward. Follow the detailed installation instructions below to get started:

### Prerequisites 📋

Before proceeding with the installation, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- **SWI-Prolog**: The Predictive Maintenance System relies on SWI-Prolog as the runtime environment. If you haven't already installed SWI-Prolog, you can download it from the official website [here](https://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

### Clone the Repository 📦

Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following Git command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rishit-katiyar/predictive-maintenance-system.git
```

### Navigate to the Project Directory 📂

Once you've cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory using your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
cd predictive-maintenance-system
```

### Run the Prolog Program 🏃‍♂️

With the project directory as your current working directory, launch the Prolog program using the SWI-Prolog interpreter. Execute the following command to start the Predictive Maintenance System:

```bash
swipl predictive_maintenance_system.pl
```

## Usage 🧑‍💻

Upon launching the Predictive Maintenance System, you gain access to a comprehensive suite of tools and functionalities for monitoring industrial equipment health and predicting maintenance needs. Interact with the system to simulate sensor readings for different equipment types, analyze the predicted maintenance requirements based on predefined rules, and make informed decisions to optimize maintenance schedules and maximize equipment uptime.
